# System identification

System identification is the art and science of using data in the process of building a model of a system.

## Model calibration
For calibration of parameters in ModelingToolkit models, see [JuliaSimModelOptimizer.jl](https://help.juliahub.com/jsmo/dev/).

## Linear model estimation
For estimation of LTI models, such as statespace models or transfer functions, using techniques such as the prediction-error method (PEM), subspace-based identification and frequency-domain fitting, see [ControlSystemIdentification.jl](https://baggepinnen.github.io/ControlSystemIdentification.jl/stable/).

For an example of designing an MPC controller using a model estimated from data, see [MPC with model estimated from data](@ref):
